# See sounds

These scripts allow you to add 3D worldized subtitles in your Godot 4 games.

# How to use

Simply download the scripts and add them to your project, then add "subtitle_manager.tscn" as a singleton using Godot's autoload system.

Now add the subtitle trigger to any AudioStreamPlayer3D, and a subtitle will be displayed every time that sound is triggered.
